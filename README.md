# qutip-lattice
QuTiP lattice package
=====================

QuTiP-lattice is open-source software for simulating lattice models.
QuTiP-lattice aims to provide user-friendly and efficient interface to study
lattice module using QuTiP. It was first developed as during Google Summer
of Coding 2019. QuTiP-lattice is freely available for use and/or modification
on all common platforms. Being free of any licensing fees, QuTiP-lattice is
ideal for exploring quantum mechanics in research as well as in the classroom.
